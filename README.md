Drawing inspiration from Zaha Hadidâ€™s honeycomb building in Riyadh has showcased remarkable architectural innovation, even though the high cost of the materials and the fact that its non-eco-friendly make a horrible impact on the environment. Consequently, this project is a smart honeycomb building from cottonstalk instead of burning it, which produces greenhouse gases and increases climate change. The eco-friendly building depends on solar energy as its main electricity source and a combination of different sensors, such as a CO sensor to detect monoxide leakage from a gas heater and a humidity sensor. The chosen solution achieved the following design requirements: decreasing temperature by three degrees from the outer environment; detecting monoxide leakage from gas heaters by CO sensor to avoid frequent accidents due to CO leakage, which cause chocking by open the window by servo motor; and using a using a DHT sensor to measure humidity and turn on the fan if humidity increases. The solution will achieve the required designs since cottonwood, a natural material, has a lower thermal conductivity than concrete. Solar energy is a quick type of energy, and for the structure, honeycomb is marked by its light size and durability, and for its large surface area, it could distribute heat. The total volume of the building will be 0.121 m3.
